//How do "while loops" work?
	//An explanation by a very forgetful programmer
//Step 1; Create a variable, say "dadJoke". Set the value to a number, say "1"
//Step 2; Decide how many times you want the thing to happen, say four times.
//Create a While loop, "while(dadJoke(the variable)<=4(the number of times you want the thing to happen)){
					//The thing happens
					//dadJoke=dadJoke+1
					//}
